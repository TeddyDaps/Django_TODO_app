# 🧠 TaskFlow — The Ultimate Django To-Do App

**TaskFlow** isn’t just a to-do list.  
It’s a full-featured, production-quality task manager built with **Django + PostgreSQL**, designed to show off **clean architecture, modern UI, and professional UX**.

This project proves I can build real software — not just scripts, but secure, scalable, beautifully structured applications that matter.

## 🚀 What Makes This Special?

- 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**  
  Secure login, logout, and password change using Django's built-in system — but styled my way.

- 🎨 **Fully Themed UI**  
  Light/dark mode toggle that remembers your choice, styled with Bootstrap 5.3.

- 🧭 **Modern UX**  
  Success messages, auto-dismiss alerts, intuitive navigation — everything you'd expect from a polished SaaS app.

- 📝 **Smart Task Management**  
  Create, edit, filter by priority, search by text, and track what’s done.

- 🧼 **Custom Error Pages (with style)**  
  403, 404, and 500 — all with friendly messages and memes, because users deserve it.

- 🧍 **User Control**  
  View your profile. Change your password. Even delete your account. You're in control.
